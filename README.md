# mass-renamer
Some notebooks (hopefully soon to be standalone scripts) to rename files en masse.
---
# Usage
## Generate Prerequisite Files and Directories
- A text file titled `month-year.txt`
- A text file titled `filepaths.txt`
- A directory titled `filenames`
All of these should be created in the same location with the notebook.

## Write In Necessary Information
### `month-year.txt`
This file should only have a single line
: A month name and the year (e.g. June 23). Format this information to your liking.
